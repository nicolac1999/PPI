# Protein-protein-interaction - Link Prediction


Project for the Data Science Honors programme 2021-2022

The aim of the project is Link prediction on proteins interaction based on Graph Neural Network

Dataset is a graph containing everything known about protein-protein interaction in humans. The link is [BIOGRID ORGAMISM](https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-4.4.208/)
